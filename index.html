    <h1>Croissants</h1>
    <p>
      Croissants are delectable pastries that have become synonymous with French
      cuisine. These buttery delights are made from layers of dough, which are
      carefully folded and rolled to create a flaky texture. The origin of
      croissants can be traced back to the 17th century in Austria, but it was
      the French who perfected the recipe and made it internationally renowned.
      The traditional French croissant is characterized by its crescent shape,
      golden brown exterior, and delicate, buttery taste. Whether enjoyed plain,
      filled with chocolate or almond paste, or served alongside a cup of
      coffee, croissants are a true culinary delight that can transport you to
      the enchanting streets of Paris with every bite.
